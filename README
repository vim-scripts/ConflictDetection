DESCRIPTION
This plugin detects and highlights conflict markers such as <<<<<<<, =======,
and >>>>>>>, which are inserted by source code management systems on merges to
indicate that the automatic resolution failed; this plugin helps you with
becoming aware of and finding them.

RELATED WORKS
To quickly locate and resolve the conflicts, you can use the motions and text
objects provided by the companion ConflictMotions.vim plugin (vimscript
#3991).


USAGE
The plugin automatically adds syntax definitions for the conflict markers and
the conflicted lines which are enclosed in the markers. Lines originating from
"our" version are highlighted in a different way than lines from "their"
version (1), so it's easier for you to visually differentiate the alternatives
and make the right editing choices to resolve the conflict. The "base" version
of the diff3-style syntax is supported, too.

(1) unless the filetype's own syntax somehow interferes with it

The plugin warns you when a buffer that contains conflict markers is edited or
saved. Cp. g:ConflictDetection_WarnEvents

The detections stores its status in the buffer variable b:conflicted. You can
evaluate this boolean variable in a custom statusline to indicate whether
the buffer contains conflicts.
